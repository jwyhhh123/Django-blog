    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <ul>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently an undergraduate student (2018-2021) studying Artificial Intelligence in the University of Birmingham. I have developed excellent programming skills and analytical skills during the time. For now, Java is my most familiar language and I have been also learning Haskell, C/C++ and Python in my second year study. I have great interests in Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision. This means that my study will be in the direction of Artificial Intelligence. 
		Outside the uni life, I am willing to meet more people who are better than me. Sometimes it is like climbing a mountain, from 0 to 100 meters high, then go from 100 to 1000â€¦ and the landscapes are unique. I am keen to view somewhere far enough and wide enough.
